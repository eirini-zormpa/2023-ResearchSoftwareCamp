# About
This repository contains the slides for the *How to publish FAIR research outputs* session on 19 June 2023, part of the 2023 [Research Software Camp: FAIR software](https://software.ac.uk/RSC-fair-software) otganised by the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/).

## Learning objectives
- ✅ To expand the definition of “research outputs”
- ✅ To define the FAIR principles
- ✅ To explain how to choose a repository
- ✅ To demonstrate how to use a repository for archiving research outputs

These slides were originally created for the session of the same name, presented at the [2023 RSF Conference](https://aim-rsf.github.io/training/FAIR-publishing/FAIR-publishing#/title-slide). Those slides were partly based on the slides used for a workshop on [FAIR and Frictionless workflows for tabular data](https://github.com/eirini-zormpa/frictionless-data-workshop).

The images folder includes visualisation created by Scriberia for the Turing Way for convenience.
If you would like to reuse any of these visualisations, please refer to the [Zenodo repository where they are archived](https://zenodo.org/record/7587336#.ZEot1HbMIV8).
