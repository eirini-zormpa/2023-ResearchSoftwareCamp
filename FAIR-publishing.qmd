# Why and what to share{background-color="#F26B5E"}

## Advertising scholarship

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely **advertising** of the scholarship.

::: {.fragment .fade-down}

## The actual scholarship

The actual outputs created during a research project will differ but some examples include:

- Preregistrations
- Presentations and posters on your findings
- Datasets
- Protocols and workflows
- Code (analysis scripts and software packages)
- Other outputs, e.g. educational materials

## The actual scholarship

The actual outputs created during a research project will differ but some examples include:

- Preregistrations
- Presentations and posters on your findings
- **[Datasets]{style="color:#F2B705"}**
- Protocols and workflows
- **[Code (analysis scripts and software packages)]{style="color:#F2B705"}**
- Other outputs, e.g. educational materials

. . .

**You don't know what will be useful for others!**

## Example

## Why share all these other outputs?

![](images/share-work.jpg)


## What (not) to share

- Personal data is tricky - some data can be shared with proper consent and (pseudo)anonymisation.

. . . 

- Confidential data that's commercially sensitive or relevant for national security - talk to the data provider about what you **can** share.

. . . 

- Really big data (e.g. in quantum computing, cosmology) - think about what data is **necessary** and whether the data can be recreated.

. . .

- Anything that you found online that isn't licensed for reuse - *more on licences later*!


# How to share{background-color="#F26B5E"}

## The FAIR principles

![](images/FAIRPrinciples.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Findable: Metadata :mag:

First people need to be able to find your outputs!

. . .

For outputs to be findable, they need to be described with **rich metadata**.
These metadata can be generic (e.g. title, author name, keywords) or discipline-specific.

<br>

. . .

### Resources
- [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/): a curated resource to help you find (among others) metadata standards

. . .

- [CodeMeta generator](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/): a tool to create a minimal metadata file for software



## Findable: Persistent identifiers :mag:

Outputs should also be assigned a **unique and persistent identifier**, e.g. a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
This makes it easy to find outputs, but also to link them with other relevant information (e.g. a publication).

![](images/DOI.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Findable: Persistent identifiers for people :mag:

Persistent identifiers for researchers help if you have a common name or if you change your name!

![](images/OrcidIDs.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Task: Create an ORCID iD {background-color="#F2B705"}

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

:alarm_clock: **3 minutes**

1. Navigate to [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/) on your browser
2. Select Sign in/Register and then Register as a new user
3. Fill in the information required


## Accessible: Define processes :door:

After people have found your outputs they need to be able to access them!

- :unlock: This could mean that they are openly and freely available in a **repository**.

. . .

- :lock: Sensitive information may not allow for research outputs to be freely shared; in those cases the **access method should be clearly and transparently described** and the metadata should still be shared.

. . . 

- :x: If the output is no longer usable, the **metadata should still be accessible**.


## Interoperable :gear:

It's important to make all your outputs available in **open file formats**, that anyone can open and edit.

. . .

<br>

Using **controlled vocabularies** is also highly recommended, if these exist in your field.

## Dates

To avoid ambiguity, use the [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) standard: **YYYYMMDD**.

## Reusable: Documentation :recycle:

To be able to reuse your work, people need to be able to *understand* it.
This means you need to provide good **documentation**:

. . .

<br>

At a minimum, you should provide a **README** file where you describe what the project is about, how the files are organised and how to reproduce the project

## Example of a [README file]((https://www.zenodo.net/record/1411479#.ZEY_V3bMIV-))

![](images/zenodo-sw.png)


## Reusable: Usage licences :recycle:

You can't just use everything that's online; the creator* of the work holds the copyright to it!

::: aside
*In fact, it is often your university or institute that holds the copyright to the work you created while working there.
:::

. . .

You need to **tell people what they can do** with your work by providing a licence.

. . .

Usage licences are different for data and for code:

- Commonly used licences for data, presentations, papers etc. are the [Creative Commons licences](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/)
- For code, use [OSI-approved licences](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)

## Licence example

## How to apply licences?

:warning: **Check whether your university has a policy on sharing and licensing your research outputs.** :warning:

<br>

. . .

1. Provide the full text of the licence in your repository.

. . .

2. State under what licence your work is shared in the README file.

. . .

3. Ideally, include a [CITATION.cff file](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) in your repository and state in your README how you would like to be cited.

# Where to share?{background-color="#F26B5E"}

## Where to share: Supplementary materials

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Pros :thumbsup:

- Convenient for author
- One output to cite (?)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Cons :thumbsdown:

- Can be hard to find
- Not suitable for all outputs (in terms of privacy, file format, relevance)
- Not very FAIR (no separate PID, licence)
- Sustainability is unclear

:::

::::

## Where to share: Repositories

Online storage spaces for sharing research data and other outputs: they can be generic or specific to a discipline or institute.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Pros :thumbsup:

- Provide a DOI or other PID
- Require metadata
- Require a usage licence
- Encourage documentation
- Encourage open file formats
- Continued access

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Cons :thumbsdown:

- Require more knowledge (e.g. to pick a repository, licence etc.)
- Could initially cause confusion in terms of whether the publication or this deposisition should be cited.

:::

::::


## Discipline-specific repositories

Where possible, it's a good idea to use a disclipline-specific repository, usually for data and publications.

. . . 

- The metadata standard is likely to be tailored to the data you work with

. . .

- It is possible that there are restricted access options to account for privacy concerns.

. . .

- Fewer people may see your data, but they're more likely to be interested in it.

## Protocols

## Generic repositories

A domain-specific repository is not always available, or it may not make sense for your outputs.
In that case there are generic repositories that are domain-agnostic and which accept a broad range of outputs (e.g. from data to illustrations).

## Zenodo

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an open repository that accepts most research outputs.

- :white_check_mark: Funded by CERN, OpenAIRE, and the European Commission.
- :white_check_mark: Built on open source infrastructure.
- :white_check_mark: Offers integration with GitHub to archive code.

## Where to share: Data or software paper

For data or software of special importance, you may consider writing a data or software article.


:::: {.columns}

#### Pros :thumbsup:

- Additional publication
- More space to dig into methodology than in a traditional article

## Summary

- There are more research outputs worth publishing than the traditional paper!
- These outputs should be published in accordance with the FAIR principles.
- Outputs don't need to be open to be FAIR.
- Repositories (discipline-specific or generic) are a great place to publish your outputs.
- Data or software papers may be suitable for more impactful outputs.
